Having fun with the Rockstar language

Rockstar is a fun little language created by Dylan Beattie. As its website states, it's "designed for creating programs that are also hair metal power ballads."

To run any of these programs go to https://codewithrockstar.com/online

I'm terrible at it, but it's fun to play with.
